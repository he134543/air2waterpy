def monte_carlo(model, num, qobs=None, **kwargs):
    """Perform Monte-Carlo-Simulation.

    This function performs a Monte-Carlo-Simulation for any given hydrological
    model of this repository.

    Args:
        model: Any instance of a hydrological model of this repository.
        num: Number of simulations.
        qobs: (optional) Array of observed streamflow.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments, matching the inputs the model needs to
            perform a simulation (e.g. qobs, precipitation, temperature etc.).
            See help(model.simulate) for model input requirements.

    Returns:
        A dictonary containing the following two keys ['params', 'qsim']. The 
        key 'params' contains a numpy array with the model parameter of each 
        simulation. 'qsim' is a 2D numpy array with the simulated streamflow 
        for each simulation. If an array of observed streamflow is provided,
        one additional key is returned in the dictonary, being 'mse'. This key
        contains an array of the mean-squared-error for each simulation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any input contains invalid values.
        TypeError: If any of the inputs has a wrong datatype.
